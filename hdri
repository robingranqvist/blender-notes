# Using HDRI's

## Adding a HDRI
World properties -> little yellow dot for "color" -> Environment texture -> Open image.

## Strenght
World properties -> Strenght.

## Rotate HDRI
- Shader editor -> World focus.
- Turn on the "node wrangler" addon.
- Click "Principled BSDF"
- CTRL + T

Z-axis rotates the HDRI the correct way. Nice.

## Download HDRI's
Polyhaven.com seems to be where people get them for free.

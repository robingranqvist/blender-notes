# Using HDRI's

## Why?
HDRI's seems to be a quick way to add realistic lighting to a scene. Choose an HDRI that looks fairly similar to the vibe you're going for, and combine it with a sun lamp in similar color, strenght & warmth in order to amplify the lighting effect.

Remember to rotate both HDRI & sun lamp similarly! Also try to reach the same angle of both of them.

## Adding a HDRI
World properties -> little yellow dot for "color" -> Environment texture -> Open image.

## Strenght
World properties -> Strenght. 1 seems to work fine most of the time.

## Rotate HDRI
- Shader editor -> World focus.
- Turn on the "node wrangler" addon.
- Click "Principled BSDF"
- CTRL + T

Z-axis rotates the HDRI the correct way. Nice.

## Download HDRI's
Polyhaven.com seems to be where people get them for free.

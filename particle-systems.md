# Using particle systems

## Setup

- Select your plane / object / whatever that you want particles scattered on
- Go to the particle system settings tab
- Add a new particle system
- Select "hair" instead of emitter

## Selecting particle object

- Go to the render setting under the particle tab
- Select "object" under "render as"
- Select your object under "instance object"
- Object is now scattered

## Object under your plane?

- Select your instance object (the one that's not scattered)
- Go into edit mode (TAB)
- Move anchor point up on the z-axis

## Settings

- Render is the amount of objects to be scattered
- Scale randomness is great

## Lower amount of particles in viewport (and more in render)

- Keep the amount as in the steps above
- Go into the "viewport display" setting under the particle system tab
- Set it to like 50% maybe? (Whatever your computer can handle smoothly)
